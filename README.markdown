# WebPipes Specification

## Overview
WebPipes is an open framework for turning the web into an end-user programming environment. It provides set of standards letting the developer ecosystem create primitives called blocks that can be wired together to create executable pipelines. Pipelines can be as simple IFTTT recipes, or as complex as Yahoo Pipes, but they can also be blocks themselves and used in simpler or more complex pipelines. WebPipes is Turing Complete.
